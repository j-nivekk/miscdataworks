# miscdataworks
A bunch of miscellaneous tools and scripts I've made alongside my work in the Digital Humanities. See folders for specific tools, use cases and documentations.

I do incorporate GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT in my work, specifically in code annotation and debugging. This however should not be dismissed as negligence; as all codes I share here are checked and tested locally with utmost care.
